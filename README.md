An analysis of the financial pressures facing UK councils as they emerged from the pandemic.

In July 2021, the Shared Data Unit analysed the budgets set by 170 upper and single tier councils across the UK.

We found:

- Ten struggling councils in England were set to offset or borrow £290m after being given exceptional permission from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government to try to remedy what it called their “unmanageable pressures”
- UK local authorities - hit by falling income and increased costs - were set to make at least £1.7bn worth of savings in 2021-22 while also using more than £500m worth of reserves to balance the books
- Despite making those savings, local authorities currently predicted a £3bn shortfall in their budgets by 2023-24

Although the central and devolved governments around the UK had issued billions of pounds worth of support for councils, the body that represents authorities in the UK said civic leaders were still left with large deficits.

The approved cuts saw the threshold for which disabled or elderly individuals could receive care raised, bus subsidies scrapped and children’s centres closed in parts of the UK.

While councils had lost income through parking fees, planning and crematoria charges - they also lost millions when commercial investments took a downturn during the pandemic.

The Local Government Association said councils were not recompensed for their commercial losses - despite the UK government having encouraged town halls to invest over the past decade.

On the other hand, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said some struggling councils had let down their residents through "chronic financial mismanagement".

# Method

For our study we concentrated on the upper-tier authorities in England and Wales as well as the single-tier councils in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

Between April and June, we approached 217 councils in total, asking for details contained in each authority’s ratified budget for 2021-22 and their medium-term financial strategies.

We asked the councils to provide: 

- Details of whether it had risen council tax in the budget and how the bill for a Band D property would be affected by the rise.
- Details of any savings planned for 2021-22 and how much of that pertained to adult social services.
- Whether the council planned to use general reserves to support services in 2021-22.
- Whether the council’s medium-term financial strategy contained an as yet un-funded shortfall for the 2023-24 financial year and how much that shortfall was.
- Whether the council had applied for a capitalisation direction and how much it had applied for.
